# Darwin's Camouflage ü¶é
Welcome to Darwin's Camouflage! This project applies genetic algorithms to evolve a population of color matrices, optimizing them to blend seamlessly with a specified background color.

## üöÄ Overview
This repository showcases how genetic algorithms can be used for color optimization. The project includes:
<br/>
1. Full Python Code: Complete implementation of this genetic algorithm.
2. Video Demonstration: See the evolutionary process in action.
3. Visual Results: Frame-by-frame evolution of color matrices.
